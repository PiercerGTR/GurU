## Description
GurU is a personal Flutter project aimed at helping government school teachers and educators from humble financial backgrounds. It provides a convenient and efficient solution for managing their work schedules, including time tables and class timings.

The application aims to simplify the administrative tasks for teachers by providing a user-friendly interface and essential features to organize their daily teaching activities. By leveraging the power of Flutter, GurU offers a cross-platform solution, making it accessible to teachers using both Android and iOS devices.

Class Timings: Teachers can view and keep track of their daily class timings through a dedicated section. This feature helps them stay organized and manage their time effectively.

Notifications and Reminders: GurU incorporates a notification system that sends timely reminders to teachers about upcoming classes, meetings, or any important events. This ensures they never miss any significant updates.

Task Management: The app provides a task management feature, allowing teachers to create to-do lists or track their assignments. They can set deadlines, prioritize tasks, and mark them as complete once finished.
